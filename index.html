<br>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how this page is finna look like.</p>
<p>Many have suggested to write in public, show your work, etc. but it never made sense to me, until now. I harbor deviant ideas. They don&rsquo;t make sense, effortlessly. I was  not sure if they could benefit anyone till I found some profound corroboration.</p>
<p>Most of the things we believe about this world are things that school teachers and media personalities tell us — the observable universe is 13.6 billion years old, Earth is 4.5 billion years old, there are electrons, fermions, gluons and quarks, is hearsay.</p>
<p>I will be dedicating this blog to investigate the historical developments of sequestered knowledge and build a epistemologically informed model on the zeroth principles of existence. It may lead us into esoteric realms of ideas and experiences that is besotted against by the scientific cabals that don&rsquo;t want me and you to know — <em>the power we can possess</em>.</p>
<p>I say this knowing fully well — irony isn&rsquo;t lost upon me. <em>Plot twists</em> are name of the game
and are welcomed.</p>
<p>Deep Knowledge gives us magical skills to change the bedrock of our lives. Most divine knowledge shies away from the seeker due to his or her lack of purity — mostly because they are dumb noobs.</p>
<p>I have a compulsion to be the most interesting person in all conceivable rooms. Also I&rsquo;m properly aware of how noobish I am  It&rsquo;s clear I got starved of love and affection as a child so I must overtly compensate for that gaping hole in my rectum. Also, I love it when George Hotz fervently call us noobs. Such unbridled disdain coming from a place of good faith and competence is rejuvenating.</p>
<p>So you will see I am somewhat of a scientist myself and I am putting together this website to force myself to learn a few MiLlIoN things that are pushing the edge of reality beyond the reasoning abilities of the NooB1s united. I don&rsquo;t want to be caught pants down when the literal or proverbial meteorite furiously descends from the cosmos like them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like trying to drink from a tsunami.</p>
<p>There is no right way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good time as any to quote <a href="https://youtu.be/jhIVarkAXas">Joscha Bach</a>:</p>
<pre><code>You do not have physical identity,
because you exist within a software running on your brain,
and software does not have identity.
Software is a principle, not a thing.
